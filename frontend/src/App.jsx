    title: "Routine Mate",
    shortDesc: "A full-stack productivity assistant integrating tasks, habits, routines, and goals into one platform, with real-time collaboration and analytics.",
    details:`
      -A web-based productivity platform built using React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL (Supabase).

-Provides an integrated dashboard for tasks, routines, habits, and goals, reducing fragmentation from using multiple apps.

-Designed with a modular PostgreSQL schema to ensure scalability, data integrity, and efficient queries.

-Implemented friend requests, goal collaboration, and notifications with PostgreSQL triggers & functions.

-Optimized database with indexes, caching (Redis), and query refactoring to improve performance and reduce response time.

-Frontend features include real-time updates, caching with React Query, activity logging, and smooth UI/UX.

My contributions:
âœ… Database functions, triggers & schema design
âœ… Backend integration with database tables (Node.js + Express)
âœ… Frontend implementation for Routine & Habits pages (React)
âœ… UI/UX design and prototyping on Figma`

  title: "Asaan Safar",
  shortDesc: "A ride-hailing service built in C++ using Data Structures & Algorithms (Linked Lists, Graphs, Queues, Hashing). Features include ride matching, dynamic pricing, route tracking, ride history, driver ratings, and a points system.",
  details:`
  A terminal-based ride-hailing system built using C++ and advanced Data Structures & Algorithms.

Features include user & driver management, ride request matching (using Graphs + Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm), real-time route tracking, multi-stop rides, and dynamic pricing.

Implemented ride request queueing (FIFO), driver rating system, ride history (doubly linked list), and an in-app points system.

Focused on efficiency: Linked Lists, Graphs, Queues, and Hashing for secure password storage.

Collaborative project where I contributed to
âœ… User & Driver Management
âœ… In-App Points System`

    title: "Music Player",
    shortDesc: "Full-stack web music app.",
    details:
       `
    A web-based music streaming application developed as part of my Full Stack Development internship.  

    Features include:  
    - User authentication and session management  
    - Create, update, and delete playlists  
    - Add/remove songs from playlists  
    - Audio playback controls (play, pause, skip, volume)  
    - Responsive UI for both desktop and mobile  

    Tech stack:  
    - Frontend: React (with Hooks & Context for state management), HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
    - Backend: Node.js & Express.js for REST APIs  
    - Database: PostgreSQL for storing users, playlists, and tracks  
    - File handling: Streaming audio with efficient caching  

    I designed the database schema, implemented backend APIs, developed the custom React-based audio player UI, and integrated the full playlist management system to deliver a complete end-to-end music player.
